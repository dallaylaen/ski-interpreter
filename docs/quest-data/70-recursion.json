    "<p>Recursive functions can be expressed in combinators, however, they cannot refer to themselves by name.",

    "<p>Let's say we want to find <code>f</code> such that <code>f x = expr f x</code>",
    "for a given expression <code>expr</code> and arbitrary <code>x</code>.",
    "This cannot be done directly because <code>f</code> appears in both parts of the equation.",
    "We have, however, a couple tricks",
    "somewhat in the spirit of separation of variables in differential equations.</p>",
    "<p>First, let's assume that <code>f = g g</code> for some <code>g</code>.",
    "<i>(btw, can you prove that at least one such <code>g</code> exists for any given <code>f</code>?)</i>",
    "The equation thus becomes <code>g g x = expr (g g) x</code>,",
    "but it still contains <code>g</code> on both sides.</p>",
    "<p>Second, instead of looking for <code>g</code> itself, we look for a <code>g<sub>0</sub></code>",
    "satisfying <code>g<sub>0</sub> g x = expr (g g) x</code> for <i>any</i> <code>g</code>",
    "(including, of course, <code>g<sub>0</sub></code>).</p>",
    "<p>Now <i>this</i> can be solved for <code>g<sub>0</sub></code> using the methods from the previous quests,",
    "and the function with the required properties is then <code>f = g<sub>0</sub> g<sub>0</sub></code>.</p>",
    "<p>Side note: <code>C(KM) g x</code>, or cross constant mocker, may be used in place of <code>g g</code>",
    "to defer evaluation. This can radically decrease computation time, or even avoid an infinite loop.</p>"
